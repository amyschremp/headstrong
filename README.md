### Overview
My objective for this project is to create a progressive web application that allows users to log and track information related to their mental health, providing them with a clear space to gather their thoughts and analyze patterns. Users will be able to freely log their thoughts from the day, and select a few preset options (example: "How are you feeling today?" and answer using good, okay, or bad). Users will be able to see a calendar with a brief overview of days that they logged and go back to view the information from those days.

This idea came from my own need to have a dedicated, private space to share my thoughts and track patterns with my mental health, and I think this application could help others who have the same need.

### Features
- User Login:
Users will be able to create accounts, login, and have their own separate journal entry dashboard.
- Journal Entries:
Logged in users will be able to add new journal entries. The homepage will show the most recent entry.
- Calendar Overview:
Logged in users will be able to see an overview of their posts via a calendar view. Each day on the calendar will show an icon based on whether or not there was a journal entry. Each day's calendar box will be shown as a different color based on the user's answer to a question about their overall mood for the day, in order to provide a general overview of the user's mood patterns.
